## week1 - day6: start learning express basics 

## objectives 
learning express js basics 

## what i learnt 
today i learnt how to create a server using express js and some basic routes 

## what express is 
Express is a node js framework that helps us write node js code faster, easily and cleaner

express simplified my day5 work because it does certain things automatically that in node js we need to do manually like writing the http.creatserverit  
when sending a response it automatically set the header and end the response 

express is an easier way to write node js code 

## how to run the code 
```bash
node index.js
